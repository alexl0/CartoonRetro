This is the code for a project that can get me in the jail once and for all!
Jokes aside, I was just don't want my young cousins to see Pepa Pig so I automated a Twitch channel that shows old cartoons.

The channel is automated by a Java Maven project, and also interacts with the viewers automatically with AI!
